      The guts of this app live in the <code>~/src/app/</code> directory. You should see several items in that
      folder. Right now, you're reading the contents of <code>read-me/read-me.component.html</code>, which itself
      lives inside <code>home/home.component.html</code>. If you'd like to get developing right away, go ahead and
      remove the <code>app-read-me</code> element from the home component. Then, create a new component with the
      following command: <code [innerHTML]="generateCommand"></code>. Don't forget to delete the read-me component at
      some point! üòâ

      If you're here for the first time, you probably did so by hitting F5. Well done! üëè Typing F5 launches the default
      debug configuration. Right now, that is "Launch dev build":
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/images/read-me/debug.PNG" alt="Debug launch configuration">
    </figure>
    <p>
      You can also hit the green play button instead of typing F5 to launch the debugger. VSCode's debugger is
      configured in the <code>launch.json</code> and <code>tasks.json</code> files. Don't worry about their contents for
      now, but it's good to keep in mind that they are what drives the debugger. Debugging is explained more below in
      the <a href="#debugging">debugging</a> section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common way to build Angular applications is through the command line interface (CLI). While the CLI has
      <a href="https://angular.io/cli" target="_blank">a comprehensive suite of commands</a>, the most commonly used
      commands for building and running an application are <code>ng build</code> and <code>ng serve</code>. As you might
      expect, <code>build</code> compiles the code for your app, while <code>serve</code> will do the same and serve the
      app to <code>localhost:4200</code>. The built-in terminal in VSCode (<code>Ctrl + Shift + `</code>) comes very
      much in handy here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things get a little fancier, though. Open up <code>package.json</code> in the root folder of the app. This file
      is used by the Node Package Manager (NPM) and defines, among other things, the third-party dependencies for the
      app. These dependencies are defined in the <code>dependencies</code> and <code>devDependencies</code> elements.
      Contained in <code>dependencies</code> are libraries needed for the core app and will be shipped in the
      production app code, whereas <code>devDependencies</code> are those libraries needed for local development, like
      the Angular CLI and unit testing frameworks. When adding a dependency, ensure that it is added to the
      <code>devDependencies</code> list unless it is actually necessary to run the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the top of the file, you'll see the <code>"scripts": ...</code> element:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/images/read-me/npm-scripts.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>
      These are convenience scripts for common tasks in the application. Little more than snippets, they can be executed
      using the NPM CLI like so: <code>npm run [script name]</code> Give it a shot! Try running the "start" script with
      <code>npm run start</code>. You'll notice in the output that it'll print out the command that it's actually
      executing. That is to say, running <code>npm run start</code> is equivalent to simply running
      <code>ng serve -o</code>. This may seem silly, but it can be very convenient when a particular command requires a
      complicated combination of flags to be set or other commands be run in combination. The
      <code>start:app-shell</code> script is a good example of this.
    </p>
    <p>Commands like <code>start</code> and <code>test</code> are "standard" NPM scripts that virtually every app has.
      NPM allows you to execute these scripts without the <code>run</code> keyword, so <code>npm start</code> is an
      equivalent shorthand for <code>npm run start</code>. NPM scripts can be named anything, but only those two will
      allow for this shorthand; all others must invoke the <code>run</code> command.

    <p>
      <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/pages/docs_home.html" target="_blank">Jasmine</a> is the built-in unit testing
      framework for Angular. The tests themselves are run by the
      <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html" target="_blank">Karma</a> test runner. To engage the
      Karma runner to run the Jasmine tests for this project, open the terminal and run <code>npm test</code>. Karma
      will run the app's unit tests against three headless (i.e. without opening a window) browsers in succession:
      Chrome, FireFox, and IE (although IE has no headless configuration so an IE window will actually appear). Karma
      will then print the results of the tests to the terminal window.

      <h3 id='debugging'>Debugging</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      There are several different configurations in place to build and run this application. Hitting F5 executes the
      selected debug config in VSCode, which by default is "Launch dev build". The "Launch dev build" and "Launch prod
      build" debugger configurations in this app (defined in <code>launch.json</code>) simply run an npm script and
      attach the VSCode debugger to an instance of Chrome. In order for this to work, the
      <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome"
        target="_blank">Debugger For Chrome</a> VSCode extension is a prerequisite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once running, the debugger behaves a lot like the Visual Studio debugger that you may be used to. Find
      <code>read-me.component.ts</code> and place a breakpoint in the <code>ngOnInit()</code> method:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/images/read-me/breakpoint.PNG" alt="Breakpoint in ngOnInit">
    </figure>
    <p>
      Manually refresh your browser and you should hit your breakpoint. On the left pane, you'll see the usual debugger
      information: variables in this scope, any watch conditions you may have set up, the current call stack, etc. You
      can resume execution by either hitting the resume button on the debugger menu, in Chrome itself, or by hitting F5.
    </p>
    <p>
      While debugging, you will have live reload of all of your Angular code. Try it out! Open
      <code>homecomponent.html</code>, change the text in the <code>h1</code> tag, and hit save. The running Angular
      server will recompile the code and refresh the Chrome tab so you can see your changes immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking on the dropdown at the top will show the other available debug configurations. The "Launch prod build"
      config will emulate how the app will be built in production: the build will be optimized and the app shell and
      service worker will be compiled.
    </p>

      <h3 id='debugging-unit-tests'>Debugging Unit Tests</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      Return to the Debug menu in VSCode and select "Debug unit tests" from the dropdown. Running this debug config will
      execute <code>npm run test:debug</code> under the hood. This script starts Karma with the
      <code>karma.debug.conf.js</code> configuration. There are several differences between the <code>test:debug</code>
      and <code>test</code> scripts. First, it will only run the tests against Chrome, and that instance of Chrome will
      no longer be headless. Second, it continues listening for changes after the test run is complete. That way, as you
      debug the unit tests and make changes to code, it will recompile and re-run the tests. Lastly, the VSCode debugger
      will be attached to the Chrome instance running the tests, so not only can you hit the usual breakpoints in app
      code, you can also put breakpoints in the unit tests themselves! ‚ú®

      <h3 id='folder-structure'>Folder Structure</h3>
    </header>
    <p>The <a href="https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#application-structure-and-ngmodules" target="_blank">Official
        Angular Style Guide</a> recommends keeping application folder structure as flat as possible. Often times,
      organization is done preemptively and needless nesting is created. To summarize the content of the Style Guide's
      section on folder structure:
    </p>
    <header>
      <h4>1. Resist the urge to nest folders. The top priority of your folder structure should be ease of location.</h4>
    </header>
    <p>
      If you're working in this application every day, you'll probably be able to find any file easily regardless of how
      you organize them. Your folder structure, then, should be tailored to benefit unfamiliar developers. Imagine
      you've never seen this application before; would you easily be able to find that particular class, service, or
      interface if it was buried 4 directories deep? Probably not. In general flatter (i.e. less nesting) is better. If,
      after a while, there are too many things in the root <code>src/app/</code> folder, consider reorganizing and
      grouping things into more nested folders.
    </p>
    <header>
      <h4>2. Organize code files by feature.</h4>
    </header>
    <p>
      This is a consequence of item #1 above. Particularly for unfamiliar devs, grouping code by feature will make them
      easier to locate. Furthermore, grouping code by feature will lead to easier code bundling and lazy loading.
    </p>
    <header>
      <h4>3. There is no silver bullet solution</h4>
    </header>
    <p>
      The guidelines both here and the official Angular style guide are very vague. In the end, different approaches
      work for different applications. Apps of different size and feature variety work better or worse with particular
      approaches. Moreover, size and feature variety change as applications age; you may well find that the folder
      structure you embark with is insufficient in six months. Remain open to rearranging and rearchitecting.
    </p>

    <header>
      <h3 id='naming-conventions'>Naming Conventions</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      The official style guide also has <a href="https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#naming" target="_blank">guidelines
        for naming conventions</a>. Most of them are enforced by the <code>tslint.config.ts</code> file in the root of
      this project. Here are the most commonly used ones:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use <code>kebab-case</code> for file names, i.e. all lower case with <code>-</code> delimiters. Avoid
        abbreviations unless the file name is very large (>50 characters) or the abbreviation is industry standard.
        <code>Good: http-interceptor.service.ts</code>
        <br>
        <code>Bad: CrgHdrSvc.ts</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow the default Angular naming convention of <code>descriptor.function.extension</code>, e.g.
        <code>read-me.component.html</code>, <code>active-provider-filter.pipe.ts</code>, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Suffix references to observables with <code>$</code>, e.g. <code>selectedPractice$</code>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <h3 id='bundling'>Bundling the Application</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      While debugging, head over to the browser instance running the app and hit F12 to bring up the Developer Tools.
      Click the Network tab to see the list of files that comprise this application. Check the "Disable cache" checkbox
      and refresh the page. In the toolbar below the "Disable cache" checkbox, click the "JS" button to filter the list
      to only show Javascript files. Assuming you're running the dev build, you should see something like this:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/images/read-me/bundles.png" alt="App js bundles">
    </figure>
    <p>
      Thus, we have four Javascript files that comprise our app. The contents of <code>runtime.js</code> and
      <code>main.js</code> are application-specific code. In order to run in IE (because IE is the scourge of the
      Internet), we must also include <code>polyfills.js</code> so that IE can understand some of the newer features of
      modern Javascript. In a production build, <code>polyfills.js</code> will not be served in "Evergreen" browsers
      like Chrome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly is <code>vendor.js</code>, which holds all the third-party dependencies for the app:
      Angular framework code, any third-party UI components, essentially anything in the <code>dependencies: ...</code>
      node of <code>package.json</code>. You'll note that this file is <em><strong>HUGE;</strong></em> 4MB is an
      enormous amount of data to be downloaded over anything other than the best-case network scenario. For reference,
      10 seconds or so of 360p video is about the same size. The final file size will end up being smaller than 4MB in a
      production build, but the size of what we send over the wire, particularly in <code>vendor.js</code>, is something
      that must be kept in check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping an eye on the 'Network' tab, click the "UI Examples" link in the top navigation. You'll notice something
      new:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/images/read-me/lazy-load.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>
      We have a fifth bundle! This highlights a crucial strategy to improve performance: the code for the UI Examples
      page is not necessary for the initial page load. Angular will separate out the code for it and lazy load it when
      the user tries to navigate there. More information on implementing lazy loading can be found
      <a href="https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules#lazy-loading-feature-modules" target="_blank">here</a>.

      <h3 id='adding-code'>Adding Your Code</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      The Angular CLI also allows us to add new files quickly and easily. The <code>ng generate</code> command will spin
      up the necessary files for a given argument. Examples of arguments include <code>component</code>,
      <code>service</code>, and <code>directive</code>. Running <code>ng generate component [component-name]</code> will
      spin up the necessary code files for a component with some hello world-level scaffolding. The
      <code>generate</code> command and the <code>component</code> argument also have the shorthand <code>g</code> and
      <code>c</code>, respectively, so the <code>ng generate component</code> command could be shortened to
      <code>ng g c</code>. Full documentation of <code>ng generate</code> can be found
      <a href="https://angular.io/cli/generate" target="_blank">here</a>.
